 Graphical user interface and command-line interface are alike in the way that both the GLI and the CLI allows users to interact with computer systems and the software that comes with to create an outcome that the user wants. The graphical user interface is a visual system which shows actions in the form of menus or images that the user can command, making it easier for users that are just starting out. Using the graphical user interface might take more time and the user will not have as much flexibility because the GUI uses the visual systems in order to make it easier to operate. The command-line interface is where the user has to write a command, and the system does something in return for that command. This allows more precision, the users have more control over the outcome of their project when they are using CLI compared to GUI. Command-line interface takes more memorization yet it tends to be a faster process due to not having visual systems like the GUI. Command-line interface and graphic line interface are both very useful resources, and what you use depends on the user's experience with the interfaces, and what type of outcome or project that they are working towards.

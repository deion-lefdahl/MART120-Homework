	Watching the Last Lecture by Randy Pausch is making me want to change how I think about everything. He was diagnosed with a terminal illness and still managed to be positive and try to help people through it. I have a had time doing this, but the past few years I have tried more to see the positive side of things. Usually I get stuck on the negative points in life for a really long time, especially if it makes me sad or angry, this is how I was with everything, art, homework, and many other things. I'm inspired by how he took the negative part of his life and made it positive. This honestly made me reflect on some of the past obstacles I have had in my life to remember how I reacted, if it was good or if I could've been more positive. 
	
	I think following your dreams is the message I identify with the most. For the past few years I've put off what I want to do, it's a long story on why but basically I lost two of my friends n high school, one my junior year and one my senior year and it was not easy for me to overcome that with positivity. I'm not mad at myself, but I do wish I went through it with a different perspective, definitely a more positive one. I didn't, and that is okay but I'm here now and I learned a lot from it. First of all, like the video says you can not take your time for granted because it can go away so fast so you need to make the most out of the time you have. Another thing is, everything that has happened in my life has made me want to approach everything with kindness and positivity from now on to hopefully help people, and maybe inspire them too. I think these are two really important things and I hope that more people can start thinking this way because I feel like it could help our world a bunch.

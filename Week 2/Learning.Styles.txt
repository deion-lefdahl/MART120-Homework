	I do think that learning affect how we learn. Me for instance, I've known I was a visual learner since middle school because we had to take the same type of test. So, if you told me I could only listen to video notes and gave me nothing to look at, and then gave me a test I would fail. I have to be able to read, and then re-write the material in order to learn it. I rely a lot on my notes in order to succeed, and I write down pretty much everything. This might be the complete opposite for someone else, and if they didn't hear it they might not be able to learn it, and a hands-on learner might not be able to do either. Learning styles are the most important thing about learning because that is what allows you to do it. Everyone's learning style is different and it is beneficial to know what type of learning style suits you the most so you can be more efficient with learning. If you can't learn a certain way at least you can find a solution if you know how you need to learn.
